### 
- **Topic**: AWS Organizations and Control Tower
- **Goal**: To manage multiple AWS accounts from a centralized system and automate various processes like account creation and policy distribution.

Dont worry if you dont understand what each of these terms mean, you will learn in deep as you go along.
#### **Agenda:**

1. **Understanding AWS Organizations:**
    - Why, what and benefits.
2. **Practical Demo**:
    - Configuring AWS Organizations.
    - Inviting multiple accounts into your AWS Organization.
3. **Landing Zone & Control Tower:**
    - Key concepts, best practices, and benefits of using Landing Zones and Control Tower together and practical demo for each of them.
    - Detailed look at the network, log archive, workload, shared services, and security accounts within AWS best practices.
4. **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**:
    - Important for managing permissions across accounts.
    - Concept and practical demo of SCPs.

#### **Challenges Without AWS Organizations:**

- **Policy Management**:
    - Hard to enforce common standard policies across multiple AWS accounts.
    - Each account might have its own set of policies(so you would have to login to each set of accounts and update the policies).
- **Security Issues**:
    - Security boundaries can be mismanaged, allowing unsafe configurations and as a result making the entire account vulnerable.
- **Billing Problems**:
    - Managing individual billing for each account becomes cumbersome.
    - Difficulty in getting volume discounts.

for an enterprise to scale effectively, a cloud provider should have solutions for the following three important challenges in cloud
- Centrally manage policies across accounts
- Easily create new accounts at scale(for isolation and grouping)
- View charges and usage across accounts.

#### **AWS Organizations Solutions:**

- **Centralized Management**:
    - Ability to push out common policies to all accounts.
    - Service Control Policies (SCPs) allow setting permission boundaries across accounts.
- **Automated Account Creation**:
    - Create new accounts automatically and integrate them into the organization.
- **Consolidated Billing**:
    - Centralized billing for all accounts, which helps with cost management and discounts.

#### **AWS Organizations Features:**

- **Root and Master Account**:
    - The root account is the "payer" account, responsible for consolidated billing.
    - Best practice: Avoid running workloads on the master account.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)**:
    - OUs allow grouping AWS accounts logically (e.g., by department or business unit).
    - Policies can be applied at the OU level or specific account level.
- **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**:
    - Policies that manage permissions across accounts within the organization.
    - Can be applied at the parent or child OU level.

#### **Key Concepts:**

- **IAM Integration**:
    - AWS Organizations works with IAM (Identity and Access Management) to manage user permissions and access across accounts.
    - Roles and permissions are managed per account, and cross-account access is facilitated through trusted relationships.

#### **Benefits of AWS Organizations:**

1. **Automation**:
    - Automates account creation and management.
    - Can use services like AWS CloudFormation StackSets, Lambda, and Service Catalog to manage resources.
2. **Security**:
    - Policies and compliance are centrally managed.
    - Enables security services management.
3. **Cost Management**:
    - Simplifies the tracking of costs and usage across multiple accounts.
    - Allows centralized cost reporting and control.
4. **Governance**:
    - Offers control over AWS resources, security, and service configuration across accounts.
    - Enables consolidated logging and auditing.

#### **Next Steps:**

- Practical demonstrations of AWS Organizations, Landing Zones, and Control Tower.
- Understanding SCPs in more detail and implementing them in real-world use cases.

This structure aims to provide clear, actionable insights into AWS Organizations and Control Tower, starting with the concept and progressing to practical implementation.
