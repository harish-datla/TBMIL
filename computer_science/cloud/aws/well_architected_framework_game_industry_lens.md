## Overview

The AWS well architected framework is based on five main pillars.
- Operational Excellence.
- Security.
- Reliability.
- Performance Efficiency.
- Cost optimization.

AWS provides multiple core components that allow you to design state of the art architectures for your game workloads.

In the context of this paper, the following definitiosn hold true.

Game architecture
  - backend technical infrastructure required to build and operate a game.

Different games have different features, so certain aspects of backend infrastructure described here might not be required(not all games are multiplayer, not all are online etc etc).

 AWS Regions
   - Physical location which can have mutiple availability zones, regions are typically named United States, Asia Pacific, Canada, Europe , South America(These are typically grouped like these based on the history of terminology for Amazons business operation centers), for example banks use EMEA, Asia Pacific, North America, South America etc.

AWS availability Zones
   - Consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with redudnant power, networking and connectivity, housed in seperate facilities.

Whether you need to deploy your game in multiple regions or not can be decided on the following factors.
   - Performance requirements for certain regions 
   - Customized gameplay experience based on location.

Following are the different types of games broadly
  - First person shooter(FPS)
  - Roleplaying (RPG)
  - Multiplayer online(MMO)
  - Battle Royale(BR)
  - Sports games
  - Puzzle games

Each of these game categories might in turn have different ineraction modes and each of these might require different performance characteristics. for example
  - Turn-based
  - Simultaneous play

Games are developed to play on different platforms and most cames now support cross-platofrm gameplay(this means game progressions is saved while playing on one platformandresumed on other platform and gamers on multiple platforms can initiate gamesplay sessions with each other).
  - Desktop
  - Web
  - Mobile
  - Consoles
  - AR/VR
  - Game streaming platforms.

Game monetization strategies
  - Advertising
  - Digial
  - Retail-based game purchases
  - in-game pruchases of downloadable content(DLC), also known as microtransactions
  - Paid subscriptions

Key performance indicators(KPIs)
  - Daily active users(DAU)
  - Monthly Active users(MAU)
  - Concurrent Users(CCU)
  - Session duration
  - Cost per install(CPI)
  - Player lifetime value(LTV)
  - Average revenu per user(ARPU) or variations of it.

## Gaming platform
  - Video games are developed to be played on broad number of platforms,beyond the typical web, desktop and apps for which softwares are usually made for
  - Video games are developed to be played on a gaming platform that provides a player experience, which is usually comprised of the following
    - Client input controls
    - Graphics
    - Client Software(known in indusry as game client)
    - Hardware
    - Plaform-exclusive features to support gameplay(likehaptic feedback and adaptive triggers for console for example)
 - Gaming platforms are generally dilineated in to following catgories.
     1. Consoles
       - Consoles are entertainment systems specifically designed for playing games, including popular examples like the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, and Nintendo Switch.
       - They enable gameplay by allowing users to install physical or digital game content directly onto the console hardware provided by the platform manufacturer.
       - Consoles can be handheld (e.g., Nintendo Switch) or stationary for home use (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation).
       - Hardare and software are usually rigid in consoles, this doesnt give flexibility for gamers.
    2. Personal Computer(PC)
       - Laptop and PC, usually customizable to certain extents based on their limits.
       - Providex fleixibility and control for players, they also do mods.
    3.  Web games
       - Games designed solely to be played using web browsers.
       - Accessable across platforms where browsers can be installed.
    4.  Mobile games
       - Games that are devoloped to be played on a mobile phone, usually with a smart phone operating system, such as iOS or ANdroid.
       - These games are usually downloaded from a digital app store and installed onto the phone.
    5.  Nacent platforms
       - Augmented Reality(AR), Virtual Reality(VR) and  Game Streaming.
       - Game streaming is aso sometimes referred to as cloud gaming.
       - Game streaming involves rendering the gameplay in the cloud and streaming to a thin client, typically an application(thin client) or web browser.
       - Game streaing allows a player to play a game that is entirely hosted remotely, typically in the cloud by a game streaming service provider.
       - In game streaming, the player connects to a cloud-based game through a web browser ro a thin client provided by the cloud gaming service provider. 


## Game server.

Game servers (aka dedicated game servers)
    - Host core multiplayer logic and server authoritative gameplay processing
    - Central piece of game architecture where core logic executes.

Core logic responsibilities
    - Managing player and gamestate.
    - Manage the interactions between the connected game clients and the game server.

Performance considerations
    - Game server is the most performance-sensitive component of your architecture
    - Must handle real-time input processing  of game client inputa and distribution of the same at scale
    - Game server requires optimized performance and sufficient capacity, especially at launch and during peaks

Terminology
    - Game server (or server instance): 
        - VM or compute resource hosting one or more game-server processes
    - Game-server process (or game session): 
        - Single instance of your server build hosting a game session, which is an instance of your running game that players can connect to via a player session.
    - We refer to game server process and game session interchangeably

Cloud hosting games on AWS
    - Multiple compute options available  to host game servers(EC2, containers, serverless, etc.)
    - All offer elastic, scalable capacity through elastic provisioning of resources to match demand without managing physical hardware

### Amazon EC2 
- Cloud based virtual servers, called instances
   - Support multiple Linux and Windows versions.
- Instance can be created and managed like any server or VM
- Multiple game-server processes are often run on one instance
    - Improve resource efficiency
    - Lowers overall costs.
-  Amazon EC2 offers maximum control over the compute infrastructure.

### Amazon Gamelift Server
- Gamelift is a fully managed dedicated game server hosting
   - Include matchmaking with Amazon GameLift FlexMatch
- Gamelift server provide an abstraction layer over Amazon EC2.
   - This abstraciton simplifies server management.
   - Available in most AWS regions which allows you to
        - Reduce latency by hosting close to players.
        - Ensure high availability.
        - Cut costs with Spot instances.
- Gamelift servers are useful for game developers who want a AWS managed and scalable solution that can scale as their game grows.
      - Useful for teams who lack the backend expettise to build ther own game server manaement and mathcmaking solutions. 

### Amazon Elastic Container Service and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service(Amazon ECS and EKS)

-ECS
    - Fully managed Docker container orchestration

-EKS
    - Kubernetes-based Docker container orchestration

-Containerized hosting benefits
    - Packs multiple game-server process or other game application instances onto a single EC2
    - Boosts infrastructure utilization

-AWS Fargate
    - Serverless compute for running containers and is compatible with ECS/EKS.
    - Eliminates need to manage underlying EC2 instances
    - Ideal for running containerized game servers where you dont want operational responsibility.
    
### AWS Outposts
- Outposts allows you to to run on-premises run AWS services in any data center or on-premises facility, which can enable games to run on-premises environments and AWS using the same services to support a hybrid cloud adoptiong strategy.

### AWS Local Zones
- Local Zones extend AWS regions, hosting game servers and latency-sensitive workloads closer to players or dev teams.

### AWS GLobal accelerator
- Global accelerator can be used to improve performance for player traffic to your game servers.

### AWS Lambda

- Lambda is a serverless computer service that allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers
- Well suited for asynchronous game server use cases like turn-based game scenarios
- Ideal when compute needs are lightweight, codebase is small or where gameplay functionality can be designed using a stateless microservices architecture.
- Also ideal where gameplay functionality can be designed using a stateless microservices architecture.
- Functions start on demand per evenr or request not as always-on servers.
- Provides the highest level of runtime abstraction for developers to choose from to host their code.

# Things to keep in mind.

Key considerations before choosing a hosting approach:
- Operational overhead
- Legacy codebases
- Performance requirements
- Scale

Hosting options:
- EC2 instances(primarily for legacy codebases)
    - Full dedication of compute resources
- Containers (ECS/EKS)(primarily for legacy codebases)
    - Simplified management
    - High resource utilization
- Serverless functions
    - Event-driven execution only when needed
    - Maximum abstraction and potential cost savings

You need to keep the following in mind and correspdongin option you have before you select your approach for game servr hosting.
- operaional overhead
- legacy codebases
- performance requirements
- scale

## Game client
- Game client represents the software and/or  hardware a player uses to play the game
- Game client translates player inputs into messages sent to the server for processing
- Game client handles server responses and renders outputs (e.g., graphics) to the player
- In realtime-networked multiplayergames, the game client usually maintains a persistent network connection to the game server for the duration of session to reduce network latency and minimize processing time.
- The game client might also interact via represetationalstate transfer (REST) with a game server or backend services.

## Messaging 
- There are typically three primary categories of messages in games:
    - Player engagement messaging targeted at a specific user or cohort of users(e.g., game invites, push notifications)
    - Group messaging between players (in-game chat)
    - Service-to-service messaging (e.g., JSON payloads for app-server, app-thirdparty or server-server messaging )

Common implementation patterns for messaging:
    - Publisher-subscriber (pub-sub)
    - Asynchronous processing archiecture patterns
    
AWS offers multiple services to help implement these messaging patterns in your game

### Amazon simple notification service (Amazon SNS)
- SNS is a managed service for delviering messages between publishers and subscribers using pub-sub architecture pattern.
- SNS can be used for push notifications to clients as well as service-to-service messaging use cases.
- Publishers send messages via API to amazon SNS, which delivers the messages asyncrhonously to subscribing apps.
- SNS can deliver push notifications directly to mobile clients or desktops with support for some of the most widely used push notification services out of the box.

### Amazon simple queue service (Amazon SQS)
- SQS is a fully managed queue services that makes it easy to integrate game servers and your game regardless of programming languaged used in each.
- Many games tasks can be decoupled and handled in the backgorund such as updating a leaderboard or playtime values in a database.
- This approach is very effective to decouple various parts of your game and independently scale the player-facing features from backend processing.

>**Note**   
> SNS is a push based mechanism and SQS is pull based mechanism, the publishing part more or less remains the same.

### Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)
- Amazon MSK is a fully managed service that makes it easy to build datastreaming and producer/consumer applications using Apache Kafka.
- Kafka is typically used for ingesting and processing real-time streaming data and can be used for service-to-service messaging.


>**Note**
> The following is straight up copied from stack overflow.
> Apache Kafka and Amazon SQS are both used for message streaming but are not the same.Apache Kafka follows the publish subscriber model, where the producer sends an event/message to a topic, and one or more consumers are subscribed to that topic to get the event/message. In the topic, you find partitions for parallel streaming.
> There is a consumer group concept once. When a message is read from a partition of topics it will be committed to identify it already read by that consumer group to avoid inconsistency in reading in concurrent programming. However, other consumer groups can still read that message from the partition.Where Amazon SQS follows Queue and the queue can be created in any region of Amazon SQS. You can push messages to Queue and only one consumer can subscribe to each Queue and pull messages from the Queue. That's why SQS is pull-based streaming.
> SQS Queues are of two types: FIFO and Standard.There is another concept in AWS which is Amazon SNS, which is published subscriber-based like Kafka, but there is not any message retention policy in SNS. It's for instant messaging like email, SMS, etc. It can only push messages to subscribers when the subscribers are available. Otherwise, the message will be lost.
> However, SQS with SNS can overcome this drawback. Amazon SNS with SQS is called the fanout pattern. In this pattern, a message published to an SNS topic is distributed to multiple SQS queues in parallel and the SQS queue assures persistence, because SQS has a retention policy. It can persist message for up to 14 days(default 4 days). Amazon SQS with SNS can achieve high throughput parallel streaming and can replace Apache Kafka.

### Amazon ElastiCache(Redis OSS)
- Provides a fully managed in-memory data stre which include support for the popular pub/sub feature that is commonly used for developing chat room applications and high-performance service-to-service messaging.
- Redis also supports rich data types, such as lists and sets, that enable developers to user Redis for high-performance queueing.

### Amazon PinPoint
- Provide user engagament messaging through
    - Email
    - SMS
    - Voice
    - Push Notifications
- Amazon pinpoint can be used to
    - Deliver user engagement messages to players to invite them back to the game
    - Transactional use cases such as supporting multi-factor authentication tokens, and order confirmation and password reset emails.

## Live Game Operations (Live Ops)
- Liveops is a style of game management and operations that treats a game as a live service and continually delivers new features, updates, promotions, in-game events, and improvements to the launched game to improve the experience for the player community.
- This is unlike the traditional way, where games were delivered as products rather than services, and new content and features were frequently incorporated in to subsequent release or sequels reather than in to the launched product.
- Liveops approach to game management is beneficial for mobile games especially , with this approach a game operations team can launch a game and maintain an engaged player community through experimentation, promotions, in-game event, adn new innovations to keep players entertained.
- This approach has additional benefits by unlocking and incorporatinr new player enagegemtn strategies seamlessly and also drive recurring revenue streams.
- However it requires more operational expertise(For exampe, the need for cloud or ackend technical infra and identifying and responding to isses that arise in game that impacts player experience/ revenue)

## General Design Principles
- AWS well architected framwork identifies the following general desing principles to facilitate good design int he cloud for games workloads:

### Understand player behaviour and usage patterns to evolve the game and protect players
- To drive improvement continually to your game and effectively manage the player experience, the following points are important to keep in mind.
  - Gain visibility into how players interact with your game and each other
  - Use that insight to drive continuous game improvements
  - Monitor and control operational and infrastructure costs
  - Detect and respond to unauthorized usage that could harm the player experience

### Use technologies that simplify game operations and increase development speed
- Adopt new tehcnologies that can improve delivery speed and reduce operational overhead for new features and updates
- Games are hits-driven and ther are many choices for players to consider, so moving quickly and adpating to change i critical for the success of a game.
- Choose between self-managed software or equivalent managed services (AWS, AWS Partners)

### Optimize your architecture to improve metrics that reflect actual player experience
- Always keep in mind about player experience when you adapt and evolve your architecture over time.
- Games workloads should be ale to withstand and minimize the impact of failures to prevent widespread disruptions to gameplay.
- Game features and systems that arent critically dependent on each other should be de-coupled to reduce the blast radius of failures and isolate player impacting issues.
  
### Design infrastructure to meet peak player concurrency and dynamically scale as needed
- To scale infra to meet player demand, preemptive scaling can be done using player session and login metrics before systems becoem overloaded.
- Reactive system utilization metrics, such as CPU and memory consumption, can be used to scale after systems become overloaded.
- This dynamic scaling approach helps us to reduce the costs of operating your game.

### Implement runbooks to improve game operations
- Operational runbooks should be used to help you consistently manage recurring game operations tasks.
- Runbooks should exist for common game operations workflows such as
    - investigating and responding to player reports
    - managing infrastructure pre-scaling activities to prepare for anticipated large-sclae events like new season launches and game content releases.
    - to address typical game maintenance activites.


# Well Architected Pillars
- This section descirbes games indutry lens in the context of the five pillars of the Well Architected Framework, Each pillar discusses design principles, definitions, best practices, evaluation questions, considerations, key services and useful links.
- Pillars
    - Operational excellence
    - Security
    - Reliability
    - Performance efficiency
    - Cost optimization

## Operational excellence
- This pillar focuses on best practices for deploying and operating cloud-based games at any scale.
- It is important to focus on operational excellence to maintain a positive player experience and take preventative measures to prepare for and recover from issues that impact thier experience.

### Design principles
- In addition to the design principles from the well-architected framework whitepaper, the following desing principles can help you to achieve operational excellence.

#### Define measurable and achievable objectives for game operations teams, adapt as necessary
- Due to the hits-drive nature of games, it is difficult to determine ahad of time how many players will show up to play your game when it launches.
- it is diffucult to determine what expectations players will have for ongoing game operations.
- It is important to set ambitious but achievable goals with stakeholders and design an approach that can be scaled up if our game exceed expectations and scaled down while game development teams optimize the player experience.
- Adequately prepare and test ahead of time to meet these requirements and make sure that business and tehcnical stakeholders are aligned on target objectives for operating the game.
- With targets defined, the game teams are able to achieve appropriate balance between cost and performance during planning, designing, provisioning, deploying and operating the game backend infrastructure.
#### Use operational runbooks to proactively plan and pre-scale for game launches and special events
- Game operations teams should coordinate wuth business stakeholders to model projections for anticipated peak player concurrency for events and perform proactive planning to pre-scale infrastructure capacity ahead of time.
- Due to the fluctuating nature of player traffic during events, prioir planing and pre-scaling activities should augment your existing automated scaling systems to improve your chance of success during an event and ensure that you have enough resource to provide a positive player experience.
- Develop operational runbooks to ensure consistency in the process.

### Establish an operating model for receiving, investigating, and responding to player support requests
- Post-launch, its is important to monitor reports of compliants and issues with the game.
- Implement appropriate systes to interact with players in a secure and effective manner to adequately resolve player issues in community forums, social media, e-mail, ticketing systems, call centers or automated chat bot solutions.


# Operational Excellence Pillar

The **Operational Excellence pillar** focuses on **best practices for deploying and operating cloud-based games at any scale**. The primary goal is to **maintain a positive player experience** and implement **preventative measures to prepare for and recover from issues** that might impact that experience.

In addition to the general design principles of the AWS Well-Architected Framework, this Lens highlights specific design principles for achieving operational excellence in games:

*   **Define measurable and achievable objectives for game operations teams and adapt as necessary**.
      - Predicting player numbers and expectations is difficult in the hits-driven nature of games, making it important to set ambitious but achievable goals with business and technical stakeholders.
      - The game architecture, liveops, devops etc should be designed to scale up if the game's popularity exceeds expectations and scale down as needed while the player experience is optimized.
      - Adequate preparation and testing are necessary to meet these scalability requirements.
      - Ensure that both business and technical stakeholders are aligned on the target objectives for operating the game.
      - Having well-defined targets allows game teams to balance cost and performance throughout the process  of planning, designing, provisioning, deploying, and operating the game backend infrastructure.
*   **Use operational runbooks to proactively plan and pre-scale for game launches and special events**.
      - Game operations teams should model projections for anticipated peak player concurrency during events and pro-actively plan to pre-scale infrastructure capacity.
      - Prior plann and pre-scaling activities alongside auto-scaling to handle traffic spikes during events to improve your chance of success as player traffic during eents is inherently fluctuating.
      - Ensure you have enough resources to rpovide a positive player experience.
      - Develop operational runbookings help ensure consistency in this process.
*   **Establish an operating model for receiving, investigating, and responding to player support requests**.
      - Post-launch, monitoring complaints and issues is vital, requiring you to implement effective and secure systems to interact with players and resolve issues. For example :                 - community forums
         - social media
         - e-mail
         - ticketing systems
         - call center
         - automated chat bot solutions.

The best practices for operational excellence are organized into three areas:

1.  **Prepare**
2.  **Operate**
3.  **Evolve**

Here is a breakdown of key best practices within these areas, based on the sources:

## Prepare

*   **Define your game's live operations (LiveOps) strategy**. This involves consulting business stakeholders for objectives and performance metrics (e.g., player concurrency (CCU), daily/monthly active users (DAU/MAU), infrastructure budget, release frequency). These metrics inform decisions about maintenance windows, update schedules, and reliability/recoverability goals. Such objectives can help determine when a dedicated Live Ops team is needed.
*   **Organize your environments using multiple accounts**. It's recommended to create separate AWS accounts for each game environment (dev, test, staging, prod), as well as for security, logging, and central shared services. This helps reduce resource contention and manage service quotas, especially as the game or team grows. AWS Organizations can manage this multi-account structure centrally, and AWS Control Tower simplifies setting up a secure, governed multi-account environment (landing zone). A hierarchical structure using Organizational Units (OUs) can group accounts by environment or studio, useful for managing multiple games. Redesigning the multi-account strategy after launch can be difficult.
*   **Organize infrastructure resources using resource tagging**. Proper tagging (e.g., owner, project, app, cost-center, environment, role) helps identify and group resources for operational support and cost tracking. Tagging policies can be enforced using AWS Config.
*   **Manage game deployments**. Adopt strategies that minimize downtime and player impact. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** tools like AWS CloudFormation or Terraform are a best practice for managing infrastructure to reduce human errors and ensure consistency.
    *   **Rolling substitution** is a strategy to release updates without shutting down the game, requiring backward compatibility. Server instances are replaced incrementally, or a new Auto Scaling group handles new traffic. This can also be used for backend services like databases and caches if deployed for high availability.
    *   **Blue/green deployment** minimizes downtime and allows easy rollback by setting up two identical environments (blue=existing, green=new) and flipping traffic when green is ready. The blue environment is kept for failback. This might involve updating matchmaking services, DNS records, or routing weights. A drawback is the cost of the standby environment, though deploying new software processes alongside existing ones on the same servers is a variant to mitigate this.
    *   **Canary deployment** releases a new build or feature to a small, restricted set of players in production. Telemetry data is collected and analyzed to identify issues before rolling out more widely. This can be for standard releases or **A/B testing**. It typically costs less than a full blue/green environment. Only a single canary is recommended on production at a time to simplify troubleshooting.
    *   **Legacy traditional deployment** involves shutting down the game during a scheduled maintenance window to update all servers. This impacts all players and should be avoided whenever possible. It risks player attrition and revenue loss if frequent or extended.
*   **Pre-scale infrastructure required to support peak requirements**. Scale infrastructure ahead of large game events (launches, content releases, promotions) based on estimated demand. Coordinate with sales and marketing for projections. **Load and performance tests** should be run against production-like environments using gameplay bots to simulate player traffic, identify bottlenecks, and inject failures. Automated scaling should be augmented with prior planning and pre-scaling for events. Request higher Service Quotas for services beforehand.
*   **Conduct performance engineering and load testing before launch**. Simulate player behavior with bots. Performance engineering is an iterative process of monitoring, testing, and optimizing code and infrastructure. APM or debugging tools (like AWS X-Ray) help isolate issues and track behavior. Injecting failures during load tests is important to see system behavior. Human testers during load tests can also catch issues.

## Operate

*   **Monitor the health of the game**. Instrument the game and backend services to detect player-impacting issues, in addition to monitoring social media. Game clients should implement logging and reporting for client-side issues (without PII). Use observability solutions like **Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics** for backend health, **AWS X-Ray** for tracing distributed service requests, and sending custom logs/metrics to **Amazon CloudWatch**. Third-party error reporting and APM solutions are also popular. Game operations teams and community managers should monitor social channels for feedback and bug reports.

## Evolve

*   **Optimize your game over time**. Monitor key game metrics to identify player trends and patterns for rebalancing the game, optimizing design, and improving infrastructure. Capture **game telemetry data** from clients and services to understand player activity (e.g., player movements). This data helps game designers review gameplay and balance elements. The raw data is processed for analytics and visualization. The **Game Analytics Pipeline solution implementation** provides a scalable serverless pipeline for ingesting, storing, and analyzing telemetry data, offering quick insights. AWS provides specialized services for custom big data processing and analytics for telemetry.

***

# Security Pillar

The **Security pillar** involves protecting information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation. Given their global visibility and large player bases, games are attractive targets for exploiters. Understanding the **Shared Responsibility Model** between AWS and the customer is crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.

In addition to general security design principles, this Lens highlights specific design principles for securing games:

*   **Monitor and moderate player usage behavior:** Capture and analyze usage data to understand player interactions and detect/respond to abusive behavior that can degrade the player experience.

The best practices for security are structured across several areas:

## Secure Access Control

*   **Authenticate requests to game backend services**. All requests should be authenticated to prevent unwanted activity. An authentication service should return secure short-lived tokens (e.g., JWT) to the game client after successful login, used to authenticate and authorize subsequent requests. You can build your own system or use Amazon Cognito User Pools for user sign-up, sign-in, and identity management, which can integrate with third-party providers. Services like Application Load Balancer and Amazon API Gateway integrate with Cognito to simplify authentication.
*   **Handle anonymous access securely**. If a game supports unauthenticated access, use client authentication for secure interactions with the backend. For game clients using AWS services, use Amazon Cognito Identity Pools to retrieve short-lived credentials for unauthenticated users to sign requests. A custom backend service via Amazon API Gateway can provide authoritative control and custom authorization logic.
*   **Enforce strong password policies**. If user accounts require passwords, enforce strong policies, supported by services like Amazon Cognito User Pools.
*   **Provide Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) option**. Due to the value of player accounts and the risk of compromise, offer players the option to configure MFA. MFA challenges users with a temporary code via email, phone, or app. It can protect accounts based on suspicious activity or location, and is supported by Amazon Cognito User Pools.
*   **Restrict access of downloadable content**. Access to game content should be restricted to authorized clients and users. Use Amazon S3 for storage and CloudFront for global delivery, leveraging their built-in restriction mechanisms.
*   **Manage S3 content access securely**. Use IAM policies/roles for internal applications and management. S3 Bucket Policies can grant cross-account access. S3 Access Points simplify managing access to shared data for specific applications.
*   **Generate temporary URLs**. Use presigned URLs generated from your backend using your credentials to grant time-limited access to objects, without requiring the user to have an account or IAM permissions. This is useful for authorized content or temporary access.
*   **Serve private content via CloudFront with signed URLs/cookies**. Keep content private in S3 and serve it through CloudFront configured to require signed URLs or signed cookies for authorized access. These can specify an expiration and optionally restrict by IP address.

## Detective Controls

*   **Monitor and analyze player usage behavior**. Capture, store, and analyze data on how players use features and interact with others to detect inappropriate behavior. Instrument the game to collect structured logs (without PII). Send logs to solutions like the Game Analytics Pipeline, CloudWatch Logs, OpenSearch Service, or third-party tools.
*   **Implement moderation tools**. Analyze logs and recordings for moderation purposes. Use services like Amazon Transcribe to convert voice chat audio to text. Apply AWS AI/ML services (Amazon Comprehend for text, Amazon Rekognition for images/video) for automated moderation.
*   **Detect fraudulent activity**. Use Amazon Fraud Detector (ML-based) to identify potential fraud quickly, such as fraudulent purchases, compromised accounts, and high-risk registrations.
*   **Detect anomalies**. Use Amazon Lookout for Metrics (ML-based) to automatically detect and diagnose anomalies in business and operational data (e.g., dips in revenue or logins).
*   **Build custom ML models**. For specific use cases like content moderation, toxicity detection, cheat detection, or fraud detection, you can build custom models using Amazon SageMaker.
*   **Capture system-level logs**. Store logs from services like S3, CloudFront, and ALB in S3 to correlate with player usage data and analyze system-level information. Analyze these logs using logging solutions or Amazon Athena in S3.
*   **Monitor bucket policies**. Use Access Analyzer for S3 to monitor bucket access policies and ensure unintended access is prevented.
*   **Security monitoring**. Use AWS Security Hub for a comprehensive view of your security state, aggregating findings from various services (including GuardDuty) and checking against standards.
*   **Control bot traffic**. Use WAF Bot Control to gain visibility and control over pervasive bot traffic.
*   **Ransomware protection:** Refer to best practices for protecting your cloud environment from ransomware.

## Incident Response

*   **Define and enforce policies for player misconduct**. Establish clear policies for responding to player misconduct and abusive behavior.
*   **Implement an incident response plan**. Have a plan in place to handle bad actors and abusive behavior.
*   **Ban accounts associated with bad actors**. Implement a process to impose bans or restrictions on confirmed violators, typically managed by community or trust and safety teams. Automated workflows using Step Functions and Lambda can update a separate banning system of record (e.g., a DynamoDB table). A separate banning system is valuable if player accounts are used across multiple games with different policies.
