## Introduction to AWS Well-Architected Framework
AWS Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architected build **secure**, **high-performing**, **resilient** and **efficient** infrastructure for their applications and workloads.

## Pillars of AWS Well-Architected Framework
It is based on five pillars
- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization.

## Advantages of AWS Well-Architected Framework
- Provides consistent frameowrk and approach
- Helps us evaluate our existing, planned architectures and implementing designs
- Remediates risks

## Focus on Game Workloads
Our focus for this is how we design, architect and deploy our games workloads in AWS cloud.

## Approach for Applying the Framework
We approach this by doing th following to help us apply the well architected framework.
- defining components
- explore common workload scenarios
- outline design principles

## Best Practices for Games in the Cloud  
Current notes focuses on specifying best practices specifically tailored to building and operating games in cloud
Specific emphasis on  designing and operating our environment for cost optimization and scalable for fluctuations in DAU.
Guidance for securing and tuning performance is also provided.
